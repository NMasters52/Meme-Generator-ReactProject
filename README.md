# Meme Generator Project

## Overview

This project is a **Meme Generator** built with **React**. Built in a scrim for a React.js course. Not deployed as this exact project is a dime a dozen. But the lessons learned on state, useEffects, handling components rendering, and the way react handles forms were very valuable. 

## Key Features

- **React Components**: The project is structured using reusable React components (`Header`, `Meme`, etc.), promoting modular and maintainable code.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage dynamic data, such as generating random meme images on user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a clean, minimalist layout.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **React.js**: 
  - Creating functional components and managing component state.
  - Experience with the way React handles async functions in useEfect, and using state to update forms on each keystroke.
  - Use of APIs and how they are affected on each render, and how to control and clean up outside effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**:
  - Familiarity with ES6+ syntax and features, including arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
- **CSS and External Libraries**:
  - Integrated external stylesheets (e.g., Normalize.css) and Google Fonts to enhance the visual appearance.
  - Responsive and accessible design principles were applied.
